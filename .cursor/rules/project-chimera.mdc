# Project Chimera: Context & Governance

Rules in this file define how the IDE's AI Agent (co-pilot) must behave when working in this repository.

---

## Project Context

**This is Project Chimera, an autonomous influencer system.**

It is an Agentic Infrastructure project (AiQEM) that builds Autonomous AI Influencers—digital entities that research trends, generate content, and manage engagement. The system uses Spec-Driven Development (SDD), the FastRender Swarm (Planner / Worker / Judge), and MCP for all external I/O. The repository is the "factory" that will eventually be built by a swarm of AI agents with minimal human conflict.

## The Prime Directive

**NEVER generate code without checking specs/ first.**

- Intent and contracts live in `specs/`: `_meta.md`, `functional.md`, `technical.md`, and feature-specific specs under `specs/001-*`.
- Before writing or changing implementation code, read the relevant spec (functional requirements, API contracts, database schema). If the spec is vague or missing, clarify or extend the spec before implementing.
- Ambiguity in specs leads to agent hallucination; keep specs the single source of truth.

---

## Traceability

**Explain your plan before writing code.**

- When asked to implement a feature or fix, state which spec(s) and user story (or contract) you are implementing.
- Reference specific sections (e.g. "Implementing A-2 from specs/functional.md and Task schema from specs/technical.md").
- Distinguish between **Skills** (reusable functions/scripts the agent calls, e.g. in `skills/`) and **MCP Servers** (external bridges). Do not conflate them.
- Commit messages and PR descriptions should reference spec artifacts where applicable.

## Co-pilot behavior summary

1. **Context**: Assume Project Chimera (autonomous influencer system); resolve intent from `specs/` only.
2. **Before code**: Check specs first; if unclear, clarify or extend the spec, then implement.
3. **Before edits**: Briefly state your plan and which spec(s) you are following, then write or change code.
